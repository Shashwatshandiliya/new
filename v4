In today's lightning-fast FX markets, institutional clients are overwhelmed by hundreds of pages of overnight research, macro commentary, and breaking news -- causing them to spend valuable minutes scrolling through static PDF documents rather than making decisions based on data. Insight latency erodes trading alpha, frustrates front-office teams, increases risk exposure, and allows our competitors to race ahead of us using automated AI summaries.


We need to develop an AI-Powered FX Intelligence Co-Pilot that converts every internal report, every external news feed and every live data stream into one-minute on-demand video briefings, multi-lingual text summaries and automatically-generated interactive charts personalized to each client's trading style, region, and language preference.


By reducing time-to-insight from hours to seconds, we will enable clients to take faster action, and capture fleeting market opportunities, and increase client engagement through a seamless digital advisory channel. Not only will this prototype improve our market-leading research, but it will develop and monetize new sources of revenue, decrease analyst workloads, and establish Standard Chartered as the clear leader in AI-powered FX intelligence.
