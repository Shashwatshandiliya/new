Hello, I’m Shashwat, a software engineer .
I recently completed two courses in the “Finance for Everyone” series—“Decisions” and “Value.”
And in the next few minutes, I’d like to do two quick things:
1.	Share seven big ideas that really stuck with me, and
2.	Tell you two small stories from my own desk that show how I’m already putting these ideas into action.
________________________________________
Let’s start with the big ideas.
BIG IDEA #1: Every money decision comes from two pockets.
Pocket A is equity—your own cash.
Pocket B is debt—someone else’s.
If we mix them up, goals get blurry. But if we keep them separate, everyone knows what return—or repayment—they’re expecting.
________________________________________
BIG IDEA #2: Time is money—literally.
There’s this one formula that lets you push money forward using compounding, or pull it back using discounting.
It lets you compare something like “pay ฿10,000 today” versus “pay ฿11,500 in two years”—and put them on the same playing field.
________________________________________
BIG IDEA #3: Those small, regular payments? They’re just annuities in disguise.
Whether it’s ฿200 a month for Netflix, ฿6,000 a year for a cloud licence, or ฿10,000 every quarter into savings—it’s all the same math.
One calculator button shows you the real, total cost.
________________________________________
BIG IDEA #4: How often interest is applied can quietly change everything.
10% once a year is 10%.
But divide that into 12 monthly pieces and it becomes 10.47%.
That tiny difference? It’s the difference between a good deal and a bad one.

BIG IDEA #5: Valuation tools are like a passport—they help your project cross the funding border.
ROI and Payback are quick gut-checks.
NPV and IRR bring in time and risk.
If an idea can’t pass even one of these gates, the answer should be simple: no funding.
________________________________________
BIG IDEA #6: Garbage in, garbage out—so clean inputs matter.
There are five golden rules for keeping your models honest:
✅ Treat projects as stand-alone
✅ Only include incremental numbers
✅ Focus on real cash flows
✅ Include opportunity costs
❌ Exclude sunk costs
Follow the rules, and the spreadsheet tells the truth. Break them, and it doesn’t.
________________________________________
BIG IDEA #7: We can price risk, but we only respect uncertainty.
Volatility? Sure, we can measure and charge for it.
But true uncertainty—like a pandemic or a sudden policy shift? That’s different.
The only defense is preparation: keep cash buffers, don’t over-borrow, and always diversify.
________________________________________
Now, how does a software engineer use this?
Let me share two tiny stories from just this month.
________________________________________
STORY ONE: The licence dilemma.
We were using a test automation tool that cost ฿9,000 a year or ฿900 a month.
Old me went for monthly—it felt flexible.
But then I ran the annuity math: 900 × 12 = ฿10,800.
Same tool. ฿1,800 more.
So we switched to annual. Quick decision, big save.
That’s Pocket A staying fatter instead of leaking.
________________________________________
STORY TWO: The new-phone temptation.
A shop offered a “no-interest” plan: ฿1,000 per month for 30 months.
Cash price: ฿24,000.
Looked like a win—until I used Big Idea #4.
Turns out, that “zero-interest” plan? It's actually costing around 20% per year.
So I kept my old phone, invested the cash, and I’ll buy the next model outright.
Result? I avoided a hidden finance charge of ฿6,000.
________________________________________
So what’s the pattern here?
Everyday choices → cash-flow questions.
I run them through six simple formulas—and let the numbers speak.
These courses didn’t turn me into an investment banker, but they did give me something better:
A pocket translator—that turns vague ideas like “subscribe monthly” or “zero-interest” into clear  values anyone can understand.
They also gave me guardrails:
✅ Diversify
✅ Hold cash
✅ Pay down high-interest debt
✅ And always, always keep Pocket A and Pocket B separate.
Thanks so much for your time.
